jeeq is an encrypting tool using ECDSA.
ECDSA is not designed for encryption, but by tricking it one can make it encrypt anything.
Please note it's not a code you can rely on. Don't even think about implementing that into a working project.

No dependencies

Usage:
 Install python 2.x and run ./jeeq.py
